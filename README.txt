This is our 3710 CPU Project created by Carlos, Zyad, Hibban and Jonny.

We have seperated our files into different folders containing all their respective files.
If you wish to run our final code, you need to add CPU, CPU_Wrapper, CPU_FSM
vga_control, bram, nes_input, RegBank, Decoder_4to16, instruction_reg, 
ALU, MUX_16to1, MUX_2to1, hexTo7Seg, Five_Bit_Register, Program_counter, pc_displace,
decoder and clkDivider.

Set CPU_Wrapper as the top level entity.

Thank you.
